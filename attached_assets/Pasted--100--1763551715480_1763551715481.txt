Отлично, я понял вас на 100%! Это большой и очень подробный запрос, который охватывает как внешний вид, так и критически важную логику работы админки и меню. Я сгенерировал изображение, которое будет использовано в этом ответе.




Вот детальный план для Replit AI, чтобы он мог полностью решить эти задачи. Я сформулирую это на английском, как вы просили, максимально чётко и со всеми нюансами.

Master Prompt for Replit AI - PokePao Project Finalization

Goal: Achieve a production-ready, visually appealing, and functionally robust PokePao application, with a focus on administrative UX, menu logic, and gallery presentation.

Part 1: Visual & UX Enhancements
Favicon Update:

Instruction: Implement the provided image as the site's favicon.

Details: The image (imagine an image file was uploaded here or provided in context) should be saved as favicon.png in the client/public/ directory. No code changes are required in client/index.html as the <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="/favicon.png" /> tag is already in place.

Admin Panel Design Overhaul (UX & Aesthetics):

Instruction: Redesign the administrative interface to be significantly more modern, minimalist, and user-friendly. Eliminate the current "ugly" default styling.

Specifics:

Borders & Spacing: Remove default black borders, stark white backgrounds, and tight spacing around elements (buttons, input fields, sections). Introduce appropriate padding and margins.

Input Fields & Fonts: Make input fields visually distinct and clean. Improve font styling (colors, sizes) for better readability, moving away from dull gray defaults.

Overall Impression: Aim for a clean, intuitive, and professional look that is easy on the eyes and simple to navigate, without being overly complex. No fancy animations or heavy UI frameworks, just a cleaner default style.

Main Page Gallery Enhancement:

Instruction: Significantly improve the display of the image gallery on the main page.

Specifics:

Size: Make the gallery images noticeably larger and more prominent on desktop view. They currently appear "very small" and unattractive.

Responsiveness: Ensure the larger gallery images maintain a "beautiful" and optimized appearance across all devices, especially on mobile phones. Review and adjust layouts for mobile to prevent awkward cropping or tiny displays.

Content: Ensure all existing photos that are part of the gallery are actually displayed, both on the main page and within the admin gallery management section.

Part 2: Admin Panel Logic & Data Consistency
Gallery Management in Admin:

Instruction: Ensure the admin panel's gallery editing section accurately reflects all current images displayed on the main site.

Specifics: Three existing gallery photos are currently missing from the admin interface. These must be added and properly manageable (edit, delete, add new).

Menu Item Editing - Size & Price Consistency:

Instruction: Address critical inconsistencies in menu item editing, specifically regarding item sizes and prices.

Current Problem:

When editing a "Poke Bowl" item, the admin panel incorrectly shows options for "Small," "Medium," and "Large."

The "Large" size does not exist on the public-facing menu. This option must be removed for items where it's not applicable.

Prices are inconsistent: Admin shows "Medium" at 9.50, while the website shows "Small" at 9.50 and "Medium" at 14.75.

Required Fixes:

Remove "Large" Size Option: For items like "Poke Bowl," remove the "Large" size option from the admin editing interface entirely, as it's not available on the public menu.

Dynamic Size Options: The admin panel should dynamically present size options (e.g., "Small," "Standard") only for items where they are relevant. For items that don't have sizes, no size options should appear.

Price Accuracy: Ensure the prices displayed in the admin panel perfectly match the prices on the live website for each specific size.

"Standard" Size: The "Standard" size (if used) should be consistently reflected.

Menu Item Order Preservation (Critical Fix):

Instruction: When any menu item is edited (e.g., name, price, description), it must not automatically move to the bottom of its category list.

Current Problem: Editing any menu item causes it to drop to the very last position in its category, which is unacceptable for restaurant operations.

Required Fix:

Maintain Position: After editing, the item must retain its original position within its category.

Default Order: Ensure items are displayed in a logical, stable order (e.g., by creation date, or ideally, a configurable order field if one exists, but primarily, do not change position on edit).

Admin Changes Persistence:

Instruction: Guarantee that any changes made and saved within the admin panel (menu items, gallery, etc.) are immediately and permanently reflected on the live website for all users, until explicitly changed again.

Verification: Ensure no caching issues or temporary states cause changes to revert or not appear.

Overall Admin Menu Logic Review:

Instruction: Perform a thorough review of the entire admin menu logic to identify and fix any other "extra fields" or "unnecessary complications" that do not align with the actual website's menu structure. Simplify where possible.

Part 3: Replit Live Demo & Deployment Strategy
Replit-Only Live Demonstration:

Instruction: Set up a live, temporary demonstration of the entire application directly within Replit, accessible via its unique Replit URL.

Constraint: This demonstration must NOT interfere with or attempt to use the Railway database connection. It should either:

Utilize a separate, in-memory, or local Replit-specific database (e.g., SQLite file within Replit, or a mock database).

Alternatively, run the frontend and admin panel purely with mock data (if database changes are extensive and complex for a quick Replit-specific setup).

Goal: Allow for real-time visual inspection of the UI/UX changes (admin design, gallery appearance) and basic admin functionality (editing fields, not necessarily saving to a live external DB) before deploying to Railway. Avoid any webhooks/websockets/Marocco setup that could cause issues with Railway deployment.

Deployment Control:

Instruction: Do NOT automatically deploy to Railway after these changes.

Procedure: Once the Replit demo is ready and confirmed by me, I will initiate the git push to trigger the Railway deployment.

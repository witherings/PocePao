Вот профессионально переведенный и структурированный промпт для Replit AI. Я убрал "воду", но сохранил 100% технических требований и добавил жесткие инструкции по исправлению багов.

🤖 ULTIMATE BUG-FIX PROMPT (Copy & Paste)
ROLE: Lead Full-Stack Engineer. CONTEXT: The site is live on Railway, but the Admin Panel (/admin) is full of critical bugs and logic errors. The Frontend does not reflect the Admin inputs correctly.

YOUR MISSION: Fix the following 5 CRITICAL AREAS. Do not just "check" code. REWRITE the logic to ensure it works in production.

1. 🍔 MENU EDITOR CRITICAL FIXES
The current Menu Editor is broken.

Issue A (Pricing & saving): I can type a price, but it DOES NOT SAVE. The frontend shows the old price. Fix the PUT /api/menu-items/:id endpoint and the React state in AdminMenu.tsx.

Issue B (Sizes): Remove "Medium" or "Large" options. We strictly need "Klein" (Small) and "Standard". Nothing else.

Issue C (Complex Items - "Poke Bowl" Logic):

Requirement: If I select the category "Poke Bowls", the editor must reveal ADDITIONAL FIELDS matching the real menu structure (reference image_19a95c.png).

Fields Needed: Protein, Marinade, Fresh Ingredients, Sauce, Toppings, Allergens.

Implementation: Add a JSONB column customization_options to the menu_items table to store this structured data. The Admin UI must allow editing these text fields.

2. 🖼️ GALLERY SYSTEM BROKEN
Issue A (Sync): The Admin Gallery (/admin/gallery) shows 0 images, even though there are images on the live site.

Fix: The API must scan the database/folder and list ALL existing images.

Issue B (Upload/Delete): Uploading a PNG fails (image doesn't appear). Clicking "Delete" does nothing.

Fix: Repair the DELETE /api/gallery/:id route and ensure the Upload logic correctly saves files to client/public/uploads (or the correct path for Vite/Express) and updates the DB.

3. 💾 SNAPSHOTS ARE INCOMPLETE
Issue: When I create a "Snapshot", it ignores the "About Us" and "Contact" pages. If I change the text and restore a snapshot, the text doesn't roll back.

Fix: The snapshots table schema MUST include the static_content table data (JSON dump). The "Restore" logic must overwrite the current "About/Contact" text with the snapshot data.

4. 📄 STATIC PAGES (About/Contact)
Issue: Uploading an image to "About Us" fails.

Fix: Debug the file upload handler for static pages.

5. 🍽️ RESERVATIONS
Issue: The "Delete" button in the Reservations list is dead.

Fix: Implement the DELETE /api/reservations/:id handler and wire it to the button.

DELIVERABLES:

Updated Schema: (shared/schema.ts) allowing for Bowl ingredients and complete Snapshots.

Updated Admin Frontend: Working inputs for Bowl ingredients, working Price updates, working Delete buttons.

Updated Backend: Fixed CRUD routes for Gallery, Reservations, and Snapshots.

NOTE: I am deploying to Railway. Ensure npm run db:push handles these schema changes gracefully (adding columns).

Fix these specific bugs now.

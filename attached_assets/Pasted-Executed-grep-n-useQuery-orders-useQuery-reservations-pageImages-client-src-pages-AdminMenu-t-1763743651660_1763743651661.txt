Decided on menu tab removals
Done! I've removed the Orders, Reservations, and Page Images tabs from the admin menu completely. The admin panel now has only: Kategorien, Gerichte, and Zutaten.

📋 CRITICAL ISSUES SUMMARY FOR BUILD MODE
Here are all the problems you reported, detailed for fixing:

🖼 ISSUE #1: Missing Ingredient Images in Admin Panel
Where: Admin Menu → Zutaten tab
Problem: Images show alt text (names) instead of actual photos
Examples: Tofu, Falafel, Hähnchen show as broken images
Root Cause: Image paths likely incorrect in ingredient display or server not serving images properly
Fix Location: Check /api/ingredients response and image path construction
Test: Open Zutaten tab - should see actual ingredient photos, not alt text
🚫 ISSUE #2: Order Submission Fails on Railway
Where: Customer cart checkout form
Error Message: "Bestellung konnte nicht aufgeben werden" (Order could not be placed)
Status: Form shows pickup time field but fails when clicking "Bestellung aufgeben"
Root Cause: Likely /api/orders POST endpoint error or database validation failure
Fix Locations:
server/routes.ts - POST /api/orders endpoint
client/src/pages/Checkout.tsx - form submission logic
Test: Try ordering 1 item on Railway - should complete without error
🥤 ISSUE #3: Missing Product Images in Drinks Category
Where: Getränke (Drinks) menu section
Missing Images: Cappuccino, Kaffee, Lila Energieboost
Root Cause: Image files missing from /public/images/categories/Getränke/ or database paths are wrong
Fix Locations:
Verify files exist: /public/images/categories/Getränke/[drink-name].jpg
Check database: menu_items table image paths for Getränke items
Test: View Getränke category - all drinks should have photos
📸 ISSUE #4: Header Slider Shows No Images (Startseite)
Where: Home page hero slider (header gallery)
Problem: "Header-Galerie (0)" in admin shows empty, no images on homepage slider
Root Cause: Images in /public/images/pages/Startseite/slider-*.jpg not being loaded by gallery component
Fix Locations:
Gallery component loading logic
/api/page-images/startseite endpoint
File storage path resolution
Test: Homepage should show rotating slider images; admin should list them
🗑 ISSUE #5: Can't Delete Header Slider Images
Where: Admin Gallery section for header images
Problem: Delete button doesn't work or images can't be removed from /public/images/pages/Startseite/
Root Cause: Delete functionality not fully implemented for page images, or images are static in public folder
Fix: Implement proper DELETE endpoint and UI handling for page image deletion
Test: Should be able to delete header images through admin panel
User Preferences for Build Mode: Focus on fixing these issues in order of impact: Order submission → Missing drink photos → Header gallery → Image paths in admin panel. All edits are clean with no lingering code.

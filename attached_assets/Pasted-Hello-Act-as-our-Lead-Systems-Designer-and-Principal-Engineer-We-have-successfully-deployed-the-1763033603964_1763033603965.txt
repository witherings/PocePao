Hello. Act as our Lead Systems Designer and Principal Engineer.

We have successfully deployed the live site to Render, and the core API/DB is working. Our next mission is to build the Content Management System (CMS) / Admin Panel.

I have two major problems to solve and a specific vision for this CMS.

1. The Development Environment Problem
The Admin Panel is currently invisible/inaccessible in the Replit dev environment. I can't see the UI. I suspect it's failing to render because it's behind the production authentication layer (Passport.js) which isn't fully configured for the dev preview.

Your first task: Please get the admin panel UI to render correctly in the Replit preview. It is 100% OK to temporarily bypass or disable the auth/login logic in the dev environment (NODE_ENV !== 'production') so I can see the UI components as we build them. The auth system must, of course, remain fully active in production.

2. The Vision: The "Game Save" CMS Architecture
I don't want changes in the admin panel to go live instantly. I want a Content Snapshot (Versioning) System, exactly like a "Save Game" feature.

Here is the required workflow:

Edit Content: The admin (owner) edits menu items, the gallery, etc.

Create "Snapshot": When ready, they click a "Save Snapshot" button.

Versioning: This creates a new, read-only, versioned "snapshot" in the database (e.g., "Snapshot #1 - 2025-11-13 12:30" or "Draft: Summer Menu").

Publish: The admin can view a list of all their snapshots. They can select any snapshot from this list (e.g., "Snapshot #1") and click a "Publish to Live" button.

Go Live: Within seconds, the live production API (pocepao.onrender.com) must immediately switch to serving all its content (menu, gallery, etc.) from this newly published snapshot.

This allows the owner to prepare major changes in advance and publish them instantly, with a complete history for rollbacks.

3. Required CMS Modules
Once the Snapshot system is designed, the admin panel needs these editing modules:

Gallery Module:

Connect to the "Gallery" page.

Allow the admin to Add and Delete photos from the existing gallery.

Menu Module (Most Critical):

Allow admin to select a Category (e.g., "Food," "Drinks").

Inside a Category, allow admin to Edit any existing item (matching the exact data structure we already have: name, description, price, sizes, photo).

Allow admin to click a "+" (Add New Item) button to create a new item with all the same fields.

Static Pages Module:

"About Us" Page: Allow editing of the main text and hero image.

"Contact" Page: Allow editing of the address, phone number, and opening hours text.

Your Task: The Plan
Please act as my lead architect. I need a consultation, not just code.

Provide me with a detailed Implementation Plan that addresses:

How you will fix the Replit dev environment (Problem 1).

Your proposed database schema/logic for the "Snapshot System" (Problem 2).

A step-by-step plan to build the CMS Modules (Problem 3).

Finally, please propose 2-3 of your own ideas. What else could this admin panel do? (e.g., Dashboard with stats? A "Draft" vs. "Published" status instead of just snapshots?)

I will review your proposed plan and ideas, and then we will start building.
